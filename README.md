# b64s - Friendly Base64 with str input and output, using UTF-8

The `b64s` module provides two functions, `encode` and `decode`, that thinly
wrap functionality from the `base64` module in the standard libraray, so that
all arguments and return values are `str` and UTF-8 encoding is assumed and
used.
